<h1>Annie's Favourite Movies 2024</h1>
<h2>Here are my favourite movies of the last year...</h2>
<hr />

<h3>1. Dune 2</h3>
<p>This movie in an epic dystopian sci-fi sequel with an intruiging love triangle built into the action. Even better than the first one. Five stars. Could have watched another 3 hours of it. </p>
<br />
<h3>2. The Long Game</h3>
<p>I can't quite remember the title but this is a heartwarming movie about te social divide between Americans and Mexicans living in Texas in the 20th century. The story follows a group of Mexican golfers who want to compete and join a White American golf club. Ostrocised by both the White American community and the Mexcian community over the river, this is a sure tear jerker.</p>
<br />
<h3>3. Horizon</h3>
<p>This was the start of the full western immersion Kevin Costner promised. Lacking a bit of plot direction but hopefully all will become clear in the next 4 movies he has planned for us. Visually stunning with great actors and score.</p>
